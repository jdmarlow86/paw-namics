# PawNamics

PawNamics is a clean, green-and-white themed web experience that connects pet
parents with trusted sitters. The site includes sitter profile creation, a public
sitter directory, dedicated contact and support hubs, built-in video chat via
Jitsi Meet, and a dedicated affiliate hub for partner offers.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience locally. Profiles
and community questions are stored in your browser's `localStorage` so you can
refresh without losing content.

## Features

- **Sitter profiles:** Capture location, services, hourly and daily rates, bio,
  and more. Saved profiles instantly appear in the directory.
- **Contact hub:** Reach the PawNamics team with questions or partnership ideas.
- **Support page:** Share contributions that keep the platform growing.
- **Video chat:** Launch a Jitsi Meet room directly from PawNamics—either from
  a sitter card or by creating a custom meeting name.
- **Affiliate hub:** Discover curated partner offers and submit new affiliate
  applications.

## Tech stack

- Static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile breakpoints
- Local persistence via `localStorage`
